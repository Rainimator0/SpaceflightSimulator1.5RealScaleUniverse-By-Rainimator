## Features
- Real solar system;  
- Most planet data are real data (such as radius, gravity, orbit data, etc.)(Because it is real data, it is not easy to reach the first cosmic speed (7.8km / s), and a reduced version will be produced later);  
- Chinese and English;
- Since the gravity of Phobos and Deimos is too small, the escape speed is very small, which makes it difficult to be captured, so we raised their gravity.
