## Features
- Real solar system;  
- Most planet data are real data (such as radius, gravity, orbit data, etc.)(Because it is real data, it is not easy to reach the first cosmic speed (7.8km / s), and a reduced version will be produced later);  
- Chinese and English;
- Since the gravity of Phobos and Deimos is too small, the escape speed is very small, which makes it difficult to be captured, so we raised their gravity.  
## Future Updates 
v0.1:Change the basic data of all default planets;  
v0.2:Change the mapping of all default planets.
  
v1.1:Add Asteroid belt(Pallas, Juno, Vesta),Saturn,Uranus,Neptune,Kuiper belt(Pluto),Scattered disc(Eris);  
v1.2:undetermined.

Please keep in mind that plans might change
